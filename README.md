# pyshockflow #

### What is this repository for? ###

* Resolution of quasi-1D flow problems for ideal and real gases.
* Learning of numerical flux schemes, effects and implementation.
* Implementation and testing of new numerical schemes to solve the 1D Euler Equations.
* Study of non-ideal and non-classical gas dynamics effects.


### How do I get set up? ###

* Git clone the present folder in your system

* Go to the root folder and create a new python environment (pyshockflow) through yml file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

* Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate pyshockflow
```

* Install the packages:
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

* Navigate to the regression tests folder and run the automated tests:
```bash
cd/test/regression_tests/
pytest test_cases.py
```
this should print completed tests if everyting works correctly

* The testcases folder has several other cases, where input parameters are specified inside every `input.ini` file. To run a case:
```bash
python main.py
```



### Notes ###
* The code has been written for Mac OS systems, so there is the chance for some path-related commands to not run correctly
on windows based machines. It should be quite easy to fix. With time the code will be made more universal.

* The technical details can be found in the related article ... (soon to be submitted)


### Contribution guidelines ###

* Validate the modifications by means of detailed test cases
* Ensure regression tests still work and extend them if needed
